## Class Project

The zip file you can download [here](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/tvalfx4cis2nqqdsz1qfg/dip-project-imgs.zip?rlkey=4w4d0z30oqqcq5cpe1wl23ffw&dl=0) contains 500 noisy projection images of a macromolecule representative of the types of data encountered in structural biology, particularly in cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM). Your task is to reconstruct the best possible representation of the macromolecule's underlying structure using the provided dataset. See [here](https://github.com/nv-ucsb-courses/dip_intro/blob/main/Project/dip-project-instructions.pdf) for additional details.


## Reading Material

Reading material for Monday 11/18 has been added ([link](https://github.com/nv-ucsb-courses/dip_intro/tree/main/Reading%20Material%2011%3A18)).

## iClicker

From Wednesday, October 16 onwards, we will start using iClicker in class. If you have not already done so, please make sure you have a UCSB iClicker student account ready. Here is a [link](https://help.lsit.ucsb.edu/hc/en-us/articles/360054938191-iClicker-Cloud-for-Students) with the pertinent information. The join link for the course is [here](https://join.iclicker.com/WUKC). If the ink does not work, try searching for "Digital Image Processing" in the iClicker search interface. Be aware that the in-class iClicker activities will count towards your grades. I will give credit for participation only, the correctness of the answers will not influence the grades. If you miss an iClicker activity without prior approval, you will not be able to make up for it.

## Course Description
This course offers an introduction to digital image processing. You will learn about digital images and how to manipulate them. You should have a good background in basic calculus and programming in Python as there will be programming assignments that will require coding. Discussion sections are mandatory and will have occasional quizzes that cover the material up to what was discussed in class. The main source of information will be this github site and you should check it regularly for updates. There will be Homework that will  consist of written assignments as well as Python programming assignments. These will be due every week on Wednesday at 11:59pm sharp. Late homeworks will be severely penalized 33% per day, so anything submitted after 72 hours late will receive zero credit. We set up a chat in the [Discussions section](https://github.com/nv-ucsb-courses/dip_intro/discussions/3) of this site as a class forum for you to post questions about the homework or other public questions.


## Grading
40% Homework (including programming assignments, and quizzes). The last two homework assignments will be replaced by the Class Project. Note that the weight for each homework will vary, depending on the level of difficulty of the questions/programming assignments. 20% Mid-term examination, and 40% for the final examination. There will be an in-class midterm (Wednesday, Oct. 30) and a final exam (Wednesday Nov. 12). These exams will be closed-book, closed-notes; we will provide a formula sheet for you to use if necessary. Make every effort to show up on time for the regular, scheduled exam times.
